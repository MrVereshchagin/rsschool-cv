Javascript task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
(Note: for this kata <y> isn't considered a vowel.)

```
function disemvowel(str) {
  const vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'];
  let result = '';
  for (let char of str) {
    if(!vowels.includes(char)) {
      result += char;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```
